"""The whole app with a theme, on an emulated 3.5" rev A (simulated display; bitmaps queued and paid for at 160 KB/s
and ~1.5 ms a command), on a fake BC-250 playing Hades II:
- after the boot and some dashboard time, the screen shows pixel for pixel what every widget meant to draw;
- the dashboard takes over from the boot without the app repainting the whole screen;
- radar: the sweep starts as the boot ends and never stalls.
Usage (from the app's folder): python check_app.py THEME [--portrait] [--seconds S] [--screenshot OUT] [-- options]"""
